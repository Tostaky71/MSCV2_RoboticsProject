## Description of the Project

<a name="dependencies"></a>
## Dependencies

This repository contains 2 packages : the *my_package* package has to be installed on the workstation and the *my_package_turtlebot* has to be installed on the Turtlebot's laptop. These packages won't work properly if the following packages are not installed.

<a name="turtlebot_vibot"></a>
### Turtlebot_vibot

Find [here](https://github.com/roboticslab-fr/turtlebot_vibot "turtlebot_vibot package") the turtlebot_vibot package.

<a name="pcl"></a>
### Point Cloud Library

Find [here](https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl "perception_pcl package") the perception_pcl package.

<a name="actionlib"></a>
### ActionLib

The ActionLib package provides a standardized interface for performing tasks. Like for example, moving the base to a target location or performing a laser scan. The action client and server communicate with each other using a predefined action protocol. This action protocol relies on ROS topics in a specified ROS namespace in order to transport messages.

Find [here](https://github.com/ros/actionlib "actionlib package") the actionlib package.

<a name="rgbdslam"></a>
### RgbdSlam

rgbdslam (v2) is a SLAM solution for RGB-D cameras. It provides the current pose of the camera and allows to create a registered point cloud or an octomap. It features a GUI interface for easy usage, but can also be controlled by ROS service calls, e.g., when running on a robot.

Find [here](http://wiki.ros.org/rgbdslam "rgbdslam package") the rgbdslam package.

<a name="rtabmap"></a>
### Rtabmap

This package is a ROS wrapper of RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping), a RGB-D SLAM approach based on a global loop closure detector with real-time constraints. This package can be used to generate a 3D point clouds of the environment and/or to create a 2D occupancy grid map for navigation. The tutorials and demos show some examples of mapping with RTAB-Map.

Find [here](http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros "rtabmap_ros package") the rtabmap_ros package.

# 1.&ensp; 2D Mapping and Navigation

This part presents our method to, first, build a 2D map of a room, and then let the Turtlebot navigate autonomously thanks to a pre-defined path on the known 2D map, and with obstacles avoidance.


<a name="2DMapping"></a>
## 1.1.&ensp; 2D Mapping

For the 2D mapping, we have chosen to use the LiDar instead of the Kinect, because the Kinect can only see a small angle before its eyes whereas the LiDar sees everywhere around itself, a 360Â° angle.

1. On the Turtlebot's laptop :
```
$ roslaunch my_package_turtlebot mapping.launch
```
This [mapping.launch](https://github.com/Tostaky71/MSCV2_RoboticsProject/blob/master/my_package_turtlebot/launch/mapping.launch "mapping.launch Turtlebot laptop") file brings up the kobuki base and the LiDar of the Turtlebot, and activates the mapping process.

2. On the Workstation :
```
$ roslaunch my_package mapping.launch
```
This [mapping.launch](https://github.com/Tostaky71/MSCV2_RoboticsProject/blob/master/my_package/launch/mapping.launch "mapping.launch Workstation") file allows us to control the Turtlebot manually with the logitech joystick, and visualize the robot and the mapping on Rviz. The joystick has to be plugged in the Workstation.

When the map has been built, we need to save it in order to do the next part : navigation. We use the command below to save the map, where */turtlebot_vibot_nav/maps/my_map* is the path and the name of the map file :
```
$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f /turtlebot_vibot_nav/maps/my_map
```
We should obtain two files describing the map : my_map.pgm and my_map.yaml


<a name="2DNavigationWithPathPlanning"></a>
## 1.2.&ensp; 2D Navigation with path planning

In this part, we need to modify few lines in the *turtlebot_vibot* package. For that, go into its sub-package *turtlebot_vibot_nav*, the *launch* directory and open the [amcl_demo_rplidar.launch](https://github.com/roboticslab-fr/turtlebot_vibot/blob/master/turtlebot_vibot_nav/launch/amcl_demo_rplidar.launch "amcl_demo_rplidar.launch turtlebot_vibot") file to modify it with the few lines below, starting from line 20 of the file :
```
<!-- Map server -->
<!--arg name="map_file" default="$(env TURTLEBOT_MAP_FILE)"/-->
<arg name="map_file" default="$(find turtlebot_vibot_nav)/maps/my_map.yaml"/>
<node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(arg map_file)" />
```
This modification of giving the path map, allows us to open the known map directly by launching this file.

1. On the Turtlebot's laptop :
```
$ roslaunch my_package_turtlebot navigation.launch
```
This [navigation.launch](https://github.com/Tostaky71/MSCV2_RoboticsProject/blob/master/my_package_turtlebot/launch/navigation.launch "navigation.launch Turtlebot laptop") file brings up the kobuki base and the LiDar of the Turtlebot, and activates the navigation process with amcl and the LiDar.

2. On the Workstation :
```
$ roslaunch my_package navigation.launch
```
This [navigation.launch](https://github.com/Tostaky71/MSCV2_RoboticsProject/blob/master/my_package/launch/navigation.launch "navigation.launch Turtlebot laptop") file allows us to visualize the robot and its navigation on Rviz, and activates the pre-defined navigation.
